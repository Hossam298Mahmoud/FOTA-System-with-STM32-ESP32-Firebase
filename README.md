 # Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) System with STM32, Firebase, and ESP32
![System Diagram](fota.png)
This project implements a secure FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) update system for STM32 microcontrollers using an ESP32 module. Firmware is stored on Firebase, encrypted using AES, and transferred to an external STM32 ECU over UART.
